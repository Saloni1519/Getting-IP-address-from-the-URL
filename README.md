# Network and port Scanner

A port scanner acts as a detective, allowing network administrators to explore the network  to identify potential vulnerabilities.

A port scanner focuses specifically on identifying open ports on network devices. Ports are virtual communication channels that allow different services and applications to exchange data. 

Port scanners typically use TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) or UDP (User Datagram Protocol) packets to probe specific ports on a target device. The scanner analyzes the responses to determine if a port is open, filtered, or closed.
